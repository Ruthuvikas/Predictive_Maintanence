Project Abstract: A significant prospect and utmost heed is given to Predictive Maintenance (PdM) and Machine Learning (ML). Both fields are evolving and need extensive research. This report has primarily  managed to capture information regarding various ML approaches and especially the potential of Recurrent Neural Networks, and secondly, understanding and building an ML model for PdM. 

	This report aims to be an introductory guide for those interested in using ML for PdM. Required background information has been assembled to get a better picture. The report includes development of various ML models to find Remaining Useful Life (RUL) on the Water Pump Dataset. There has been information provided wherever necessary and code snippets are presented to assist the reader in  understanding machine learning and to provide an approach to start building models. 

	PdM in itself is a technique for monitoring operating conditions to provide data that can ensure prediction in time-series datasets and reduce the number and ultimately the cost of machine failures. ML is gaining prominence as a tool for detecting patterns and making predictions from large amounts of data. Neural Networks (NN) are majorly used in achieving high accuracies for ML tasks.
